# Stream-based processing with a graph interpreter

## What

**Graph-Interpreter** is a scheduler of **DSP/ML Nodes** designed with three objectives: 

1. **Accelerate time to market**

Graph-Interpreter helps system integrators and OEMs who develop complex DSP/ML stream processing systems.  It enables rapid progress from prototypes validated on a computer to the final tuning stages on production boards by updating a graph of computing nodes and their coefficients without recompiling the device.

2. **NanoApps repositories**

It provides an opaque interface to the platform memory hierarchy for computing nodes.  It ensures that data flow is translated into the desired formats for each node.  It prepares the conditions under which nodes can be delivered from a Store.

3. **Portability, scalability**

The same stream-based processing methodology can be used on devices with as little as 1 kilobyte of internal RAM and on heterogeneous multiprocessor architectures.  Nodes can be produced in any programming language.  Graphs are portable when interpreted on another platform.

## Why

The complexity of IoT systems using signal processing and machine learning is continuously increasing.  Over four years (see picture below), the average time-to-market has shifted from months to years.  We must ease the work of system integrators by **splitting problems into small pieces**, which translates into the definition of standard interfaces between those pieces.

Here are some examples of signal-processing components and software portability issues : 

- An algorithm extracts metadata from a pressure sensor whose samples are a stream of floating-point data at a 10 Hz sampling rate.  Can the algorithm be ported as-is to a platform using a pressure sensor that outputs 16-bit integers at a 25 Hz sampling rate?
- A pattern-recognition algorithm uses images in a 300 × 300 pixel RGB888 format.  What happens when the platform uses a sensor with a VGA image format?
- An industrial proximity detector uses a 25 kHz wave generator and an ultrasound echo detector with a stream of Q15 samples at 96 kHz, normalized at 120 dBSPL full-scale.  Can we achieve the same behavior and performance with an 88.1 kHz sampling rate?
- An audio algorithm uses 50 kB of RAM, of which 4 kB are critical for fast access and 25 kB have no speed constraint.  What happens when several algorithms, or several instances of the same algorithm, want to use the fast tightly coupled memory bank (TCM)?  How do we manage data swapping before and after calling the algorithms?
- A device contains two microprocessors, and there is no MMU to hide physical addresses.
- The task scheduler must be portable to devices using an RTOS or running bare metal.
- The graph can be redesigned without requiring code recompilation or the use of containers.  Reconfiguration is managed by a small file describing the graph, which is interpreted.
- A motion sensor subsystem is designed to integrate components from different silicon vendors.  How do we automatically manage the scaling factors associated with the sensors to achieve the same dynamic range and sampling rates in the data stream?
- A microprocessor has an FFT accelerator (or a matrix-multiply accelerator).  Can we offer an abstraction layer to algorithm designers for such coprocessors?  The developer would release a single software implementation.  FFT computation would use software libraries when no coprocessor is available.

Creating standard interfaces allows software component developers to deliver their IP without having to care about the capabilities of the platform used during system integration. 

![ ](Iot_TTM.PNG)

We want the algorithms developer to focus on their domain of expertise without creating a dependency with the protocols used in the graph or the data formats used by the preceding and following nodes of the graph.

The data format translators (provided with the graph scheduler) consists in changing :

- the data frame length and the interleaving scheme (block or sample-based)
- the raw sample data format (pixel format, integer / floating point samples)
- the sampling-rate and the management of time-stamps
- the scaling of the data with respect to standard physical units ([see](#Units),  [RFC8428](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc8428) and [RFC8798](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc8798))

Computing nodes and platforms have to explain in "[Manifests](#Node-manifest)" their interfaces in a formal way.

We want to anticipate the creation of Stores of computing nodes, with a key (specific to a platform) exchange protocol, when the node is delivered in a binary format or obfuscated source code. 

We want to let the graph to be modified without needing to recompile and re-flash the entire application. The graph will incorporate sections of interpreted code to manage state-machines, scripting, parameters updates and to interface with the application.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

## How

Graph Interpreter is a scheduler and interpreter of a  binary representation of a [graph](#Graph-design). For portability reason the Graph Interpreter uses a minimal platform abstraction layer (AL) of the memory and of the input/output stream interfaces. Graph Interpreter manages the data flow of "arcs" between "nodes".

This binary graph description is a compact data structure using indexes to the physical addresses of the nodes and memory instances. This graph description is generated in three steps:

1.  [plaform manifest](#Top-Manifest) and [IO manifest](#IO-Manifest) are prepared ahead of the graph design and describe the hardware. The manifests are giving the processing capabilities (processor architecture, minimum guaranteed amount of memory per RAM blocks and their speed, TCM sizes). The platform manifest gives the list of files of [node manifests](#Node-manifest) for each of the installed processing Nodes : developer identification, input/output data formats,
    memory consumption, documentation of the parameters and a list of
    "presets", test-patterns and expected results (see also [node design](#Node-design)). 
2.  The graph is either written in a text format (syntax example [here](#Example-of-graph)) or is generated from a graphical tool (proof of concept picture of the GUI [here](#GUI-design-tool)).
3.  **the binary file to be used on the target is generated / compiled**. The
    file format is either a C source file, or a binary table to
    load in a specific flash memory block, to allow quick tuning cycles without
    full recompilation.

**The platform provides and abstraction layer (AL) with the following services:**

1.  **Share the physical memory map base addresses**. The graph is using
    indexes to the base addresses of 63 different *memory banks*: for example shared
    external memory, fast shared internal, fast private per processor (TCM), and indexed the same way for multiprocessing without MMU. The AL shares the entry points of the nodes installed in the memory space of the processor. 
    
2.  **Interface with the graph boundary generating/consuming data
    streams,** declared in the platform manifest and addressed as
    indexes from the scheduler when the FIFOs at the boundary of the
    graph are full or empty.

3.  **Share information** **for scripts**. The graph embeds byte-codes of
    "Scripts" used to implement state-machines, to change nodes
    parameters, to check the arcs data content, trigger GPIO connected
    to the graph, generate strings of characters to the application,
    etc. The [Scripts](#Graph-Scripts-byte-codes) provide a simple interface to the application without code recompilation.

Graph-Interpreter is delivered with a generic implementation of the
above services for computers, with device drivers emulated using data files, time
information emulated with counters. The Graph-Interpreter is delivered as open-source.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## How (detailed)

Stream-based processing is facilitated using Graph-Interpreter:

1.  The Graph Interpreter has only **two functions**. One entry point for the application ` void arm_graph_interpreter()` , and one entry point for the data moves: a function used to tell the data moves with the outside of the graph are done `void arm_stream_io_ack()`. 
2.  Nodes can be written in **any computer languages**. The scheduler is
    addressing the nodes from a **single entry point** using a
    4-parameters [API](#Node-parameters) format. There is
    no restriction in having the nodes delivered in binary format,
    compiled with "**position independent execution**" option. There is
    no dynamic linking issue: the nodes delivered in binary can still
    have access to a subset of the C standard libraries through a Graph-Interpreter
    **service**. The nodes are offered the access to DSP/ML kernels
    (compiled without the position-independent option) or executed with platform-specific accelerators: the execution
    speed will scale with the targeted processor capabilities without
    recompilation.
3.  **Drift management.** The streams don't need to be perfectly
    isochronous (the situation happens when peripherals are using different clock trees). Drift and rate conversion service is provided by nodes delivered with the interpreter.
    The graph defines different quality of services (QoS). When a
    "main" stream is processed with drifted secondary streams the
    time-base is adjusted to the highest-QoS streams (minimum latency
    and distortion), leaving the secondary streams managed with
    interpolators in case of flow issues.
4.  Graph-Interpreter manages **TCM access**. When a Node declares, in its manifest, the need for a "critical speed memory
    bank" of small size (ideally less than 16kBytes), the graph compilation step will allocate it to TCM area, and can arrange data swapping if several nodes have the same need.
5.  **Backup/Retention RAM**. Some applications are requiring a fast recovery in
    case of failures ("warm boot") or when the system restores itself
    after deep-sleep periods. One of the memory banks allows
    developers to save the state of algorithms for fast return to normal
    operations. The node retention memory should be limited to tens of bytes.
6.  Graph-Interpreter allows memory size optimization with overlays of different nodes' scratch memory banks.
7.  **Multiprocessing** SMP and AMP with 32+64bits processor architectures. The graph
    description is placed in a shared memory. Any processor having
    access to this shared memory can contribute to the processing. Buffer addresses are described with a 6-bits offset and an index, to let the same address be processed without MMU. The
    node execution reservation protocol is defined in the AL, with a proposed lock-free algorithm. The nodes execution can be mapped to a specific processor and architecture.
    The buffers associated to arcs can be allocated to a processor's private
    memory-banks.
8.  **Scripting** are designed to avoid going back and forth with the
    application interfaces for simple decisions, without the need to
    recompile the application (Low-code/No-code strategy, for example
    toggling a GPIO, changing node parameter, building a JSON
    string\...) the graph scheduler interprets a compact byte-stream of
    codes to execute simple scripts.
9.  **Process isolation**. The nodes never read the graph description
    data. The arc descriptors and the memory mapping is designed for the use of hardware
    memory protection.
10.  **Format conversions**. The developer declares, in the manifests,
     the input/output data formats of the node. The Graph Interpreter implements the format
     translation between nodes: sampling-rates conversions, changes of
     raw data, removal of time-stamps, channels de-interleaving. Specific conversion nodes are inserted in the graph during its binary file translation.
11.  Graph-Interpreter manages the various **methods of controlling I/O**
     with one function per IO: parameters setting and buffer allocation, data
     move, stop, mixed-signal components settings. 
12.  Graph-Interpreter is **open-source**, and portable to 32-bits processors and computers.
13.  Example of Nodes: image and voice codec, data
     conditioning, motion classifiers, data mixers. Graph-Interpreter
     comes with short list of components doing data routing, mixing,
     conversion and detection.
14.  **From the developer point of view**, it creates opaque memory
     interfaces to the input/output streams of a graph, and arranges data
     are exchanged in the desired formats of each Node.
     Graph-Interpreter manages the memory mapping with speed constraints,
     provided by the developer, at instance creation. This lets software
     run with maximum performance in rising situations of memory bounded
     problems. 
15.  **From the system integrator view**, it eases the tuning and the
     replacement of one Node by another one and is made to ease
     processing split with multiprocessors. The stream is described with
     a graph (a text file) designed with a graphical tool. The
     development of DSP/ML processing will be possible without need to
     write code and allow graph changes and tuning without recompilation.
16.  **Graph-Interpreter design objectives**: Low RAM footprint. Graph
     descriptor can be placed in Flash with a small portion in RAM.
     Use-cases go from small Cortex-M0 with 1kBytes RAM (about 200Bytes of stack and 100Bytes of static RAM) to SMP/AMP/coprocessor and mix of 32/64bits thanks to the concept of
     shared RAM and indexes to memory banks provided by the local
     processor abstraction layer. Each arc descriptors can address buffer sizes of up to 64GBytes in each of the 64 memory banks. 

![](ProcessingFlow0.JPG)

The development flow is :

1) The platform provider is producing a manifest of the processor and IO interface, jointly with the AL abstraction layer and an optional list of callbacks giving specific services of the platform.
2) The node software developer is producing the code and the corresponding manifest
3) Finally, the system integrator creates a binary file representing the graph of the DSP/ML components of its application. The system integrator adds other callbacks which will be used by the scripting capability of the graph.

# Graph Interpreter instance

The Graph Interpreter has two functions. One entry point ` void arm_graph_interpreter()` , and a function used to tell the data moves with the outside of the graph are confirmed  `void arm_graph_interpreter_io_ack()`. The two functions can be called once the instance is created by the platform AL (`void platform_init_stream_instance(arm_stream_instance_t *S)`).

Interpreter instance structure:

| --------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| long_offset           | A pointer to the table of physical addresses of the memory banks (up to 64). The table is in the AL of each processor. The graph is not using physical memory but offsets to one of those 64 memory banks, defined in the "platform manifest". This table allows memory translation between processors, without the need of MMU. |
| linked_list           | pointer to the linked-list of nodes of the graph             |
| platform_io           | table of functions ([IO_AL_idx](#Top-Manifest)) associated to each IO stream of the platform |
| node_entry_points     | table of entry points to each node (see "TOP" manifest)      |
| application_callbacks | the application can propose a list of functions to be called from scripts. One callback will serve as entry point for nodes generating Metadata information in  natural language text, ready to be digested by specialized small language models. |
| al_services           | pointer to the function proposing services (time, script, stdlib, compute) |
| iomask                | bit-field of the allowed IOs this interpreter instance can trigger |
| scheduler_control     | execution options of the scheduler (return to the application after each node execution, after a full graph parsing, when there is no data to process), processor identification. |
| script_offsets        | pointer to scripts used as subroutines for the other scripts placed in the node "arm_stream_script" parameter section. |
| all_arcs              | pointer to the list of arc descriptors (structures giving the base address, size of the associated circular buffer, read, write index, data format of the arc consumer/producer, and debug/trace information). |
| all_formats           | pointer to the section of the graph describing the stream formats. This section is in RAM. |

# Platform Manifest

The "Top" platform manifest has four sections :

- the list of file paths to ease readability 
- the name of the manifest file describing the processing architecture (see next paragraph)
- the list of available data stream ready to be connected to a graph : this list corresponds to manifest files of the data format options, and gives an index (IO_AL_idx) to the function to be called to read/write data and update the stream configuration.
  - ;   path:       path ID 
    ;   Manifest    manifests file 
    ;   IO_AL_idx   index used in the graph 
    ;   ProcCtrl    processor ID affinity bit-field 
    ;   ClockDomain provision for ASRC (clock-domain)
    ;       some IO can be alternatively clocked from the system clock (0) 
    ;       or other ones. The system integrator decides with this field to 
    ;       manage the flow errors with buffer interpolation (0) or ASRC (other clock domain index)
    ;       The clock domain index is just helping to group and synchronize the data flow per domain.
- the list of the nodes already installed in the device. This is also a list of manifest files giving a formal way to describe how to connect the nodes each others

# IO Manifest 

The graph interface manifests ("IO manifests") is a text file of commands used by the graph compiler to understand the type of data flowing through the IOs of the graph. A manifest gives a precise list of information about the data format (frame length, data type, sampling rate, ...). This paragraph gives the syntax used in an IO manifest. 

Am IO manifest starts with a *Header* of general information, followed by the list of command used for the description of the stream. The IO manifest reader is assuming default values and associated command are useless and inserted by the programmer for information and readability.

Because of the variety of stream data types and setting options, the graph interpreter introduces the concept of physical "*domains*" (audio, motion, 2D, ...). The document gives starts with the list of general information for the stream digital format, followed by the specification of domain-related information.

## IO manifest header 

The "IO manifest" starts with the name which will be used in a GUI design tool, followed by the "domain" (list below). 

Example of a simple IO manifest :

```
    io_name     io_platform_sensor_in_0  ; the IO name
    io_domain   analog_in				 ; the domain of operation
```

### List of IO Domains

See [Stream format "domains"](#Stream-format-"domains")

## Declaration of options

The manifest gives the list of **options** possible described as a **list**, or as a **range** of values. 
The syntax is : an index and the list of numbers within brackets "{" and "}". The index gives the default value to consider in the list. Index "1" corresponds to the first element of the list.
Index value "0" means "any value". The list can be empty in that case.

Example of a list of options between five values, the index is 2 meaning the default value is the second in the list (value = 6).

```
{ 2   5 6 7 8 9 }
```

When the index is negative the list is decoded as a "range". A Range is a set of three fields : 

- the first option
- the step to the next possible option
- the last (included) option

The absolute index value selects the default value in this range.

Example of an option list of values (1, 1.2, 1.4, 1.6, 1.8, .. , 4.2), the index is -3 meaning the default value is the third in the list (value = 1.4).

```
 { -3    1 0.2 4.2 } 
```

## Default values of an IO manifest

When not mentioned in the manifest the following assumptions are :

## Common information of all digital stream

IO manifests describe the stream data format and how to copy/use the data. This is common to the digital streams of any IO. The next section ("[IO Controls Bit-fields per domain](#IO-Controls-Bit-fields-per-domain)") is specific to each domain of operation. 

### io_commander0_servant1 "0/1"

The IO is "commander" when it initiates the data exchanges with the graph without the control from the scheduler (for example an audio Codec). It is "servant" when the scheduler needs to pull or push asynchronously the data by calling the AL IO functions (for example an interface to the main application). 
IO stream are managed from the graph scheduler with the help of one subroutine per IO ( IO_AL_idx function of the AL) using the template (see also next section): 

` typedef void (*p_io_function_ctrl) (uint32_t command, void *data, uint32_t length); `

The "command" parameter can be : STREAM_SET_PARAMETER (set the domain-specific IO parameters), STREAM_DATA_START (initiate a data exchange), STREAM_STOP, STREAM_SET_BUFFER (tell the scheduler the default IO interface buffer location).

Once the move is done the external IO driver calls `arm_graph_interpreter_io_ack()` to tell the scheduler to update the corresponding arc.

```
void arm_graph_interpreter_io_ack (uint8_t graph_io_idx, void *data, uint32_t size);
```

Example :

```
io_commander0_servant1  1  ; default is servant (1)
```

**Graph interpreter implementation details**

IO stream are managed from the graph scheduler with the help of one subroutine per IO using the template : typedef void (*p_io_function_ctrl) (uint32_t command, uint8_t *data, uint32_t length); 
The "command" parameter can be : STREAM_SET_PARAMETER, STREAM_DATA_START, STREAM_STOP, STREAM_SET_BUFFER.

When the IO is "Commander" it calls arm_graph_interpreter_io_ack() when data is read
When the IO is "Servant" the scheduler call p_io_function_ctrl(STREAM_RUN, ..) to ask for data move. Once the move is done the IO driver calls arm_graph_interpreter_io_ack()

### io_buffer_alloc_in_graph "0/1"

Declares if the IO stream is using a memory area provided by the scheduler (default 0).

```
io_buffer_alloc_in_graph  1  ; data buffer is allocated in the graph
```

```

### io_frame_duration "U option"

Declaration of the possible frame duration using the [Declaration of options](#Declaration-of-options) format, in a time unit given in the first parameter. See [Standard units](#Standard-units).

io_frame_duration minutes {1 1 2 16 }   ; options of possible frame_length in minutes
```

### io_setup_time  "x"

Information of the time it takes before valid / calibrated samples are ready for processing after reset. This is "for information" and given for documentation purpose.

```
io_setup_time  12.5 ; wait 12.5ms before receiving valid data
```

### io_units_rescale "u a b max"

Syntax : "physical unit name" "coefficient a" "coefficient b" "maximum value". Rescaling information between normalized (1.0  or 0x7FFF) digital ("D") and physical ("P") units with the formulae P = a x (D - b).

```
io_units_rescale  vrms  0.0135  -10.1  0.15

; V_physical = a x (X_sample - b) with the default hardware settings
; V [VRMS] <=> 0.0135 x ( X - (-10.1)) 
; 0.15 VRMS <=> 0.0135 x (1.0 - (-10.1))  0.15 Vrms corresponds to digital full-scale 
```

## IO Controls Bit-fields per domain

The graph starts with a table of 4 words per IO. The first word is used to connect the IO with the graph (arc index, direction, index of the AL function associated to). Three 32bits words are reserved for specific tuning items of their domains, named W1 and W2 below.

### Domain audio_in and audio_out

# Node manifest

A node manifest file gives the name of the software component, the author, the targeted architecture, the description of input and output streams connected to it. 

The graph compiler allocates a predefined amount of memory and this file explains the way to compute the memory allocation. See [Declaration of options](#Declaration-of-options) for the option syntax.

## Example of node manifest

```
; --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
; SOFTWARE COMPONENT MANIFEST - "stream_filter"
; --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
;
node_developer_name    ARM          ; developer name
node_name             stream_filter ; node name

node_mask_library      64           ; dependency with DSP services

;----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
;   MEMORY ALLOCATIONS

node_mem                0		    ; first memory bank (node instance)
node_mem_alloc         76			; amount of bytes

node_mem                1			; second memory bank (node fast working area)
node_mem_alloc         52           ;
node_mem_type           1           ; working memory
node_mem_speed          2           ; critical fast 
;---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
;    ARCS CONFIGURATION
node_arc                0
node_arc_nb_channels    {1 1 2}     ; arc intleaved,  options for the number of channels
node_arc_raw_format     {1 3 1}   ; options for the raw arithmetics STREAM_S16, STREAM_FP32

node_arc                1
node_arc_nb_channels    {1 1 2}     ; options for the number of channels
node_arc_raw_format     {1 3 1}   ; options for the raw arithmetics STREAM_S16, STREAM_FP32

end
```

The nodes have the same interface : 

```
void (node name) (uint32_t command, void *instance, void *data, uint32_t *state);
```

Node are called with parameter "data" being a table of arc data structures of two fields :

 - a pointers the arc buffer
 - the amount of data in byte placed after the above address (input arcs) and free space available (output arcs)

The nodes returns after updating the second field of the structures :

 - The amount of data consumed, for RX arcs
 - The amount of data produced in the TX arcs

## Default values of a node manifest 

When not mentioned in the manifest the following assumptions are :

| io manifest command    | default value | comments                          |
| ---------------------- | ------------- | --------------------------------- |
| io_commander0_servant1 | 1             | servant                           |
| io_set0copy1           | 0             | in-place processing               |
| io_direction_rx0tx1    | 0             | data flow to the graph            |
| io_raw_format          | float32       | float is the default data format  |
| io_interleaving        | 0             | raw data interleaving             |
| io_nb_channels         | 1             | mono                              |
| io_frame_length        | 1             | one sample (mono or multichannel) |

## Manifest header

The manifest starts with the identification of the node.

### node_developer_name "name"

Name of the developer/company having the legal owner of this node.
Example: 

```
    node_developer_name CompanyA & Sons Ltd  
```

### node_name "name"

Name of the node when using a graphical design environment.
Example: 

```
    node_name arm_stream_filter 
```

### node_logo "file name"

Name of the graphical logo file (file path of the manifest) of the node when using a graphical design environment.
Example: 

```
    node_logo arm_stream_filter.gif 
```

### node_nb_arcs "in" "out"

Number of input and output arcs of the node used for data streaming. 
Example 

```
    node_nb_arcs 1 1 ; nb arc input, output, default values "1 1"
```

### node_mask_library    "n" 

The graph interpreter offers a short list of optimized DSP/ML and Math functions optimized for the platform using dedicated vector instructions and coprocessors. 
Some platform may not incorporate all the libraries, the "node_mask_library" is a bit-field associate to one of the library service. 
This list of service is specially useful when the node is delivered in binary format.

bit 2 for the STDLIB library (string.h, malloc)
bit 3 for MATH (trigonometry, random generator, time processing)
bit 4 for DSP_ML (filtering, FFT, 2D convolution-8bits)

bit 5 for 8bits linear algebra for neural networks
bit 6 for audio codecs
bit 7 for image and video codec

Example :

```
node_mask_library  64  ; the node has a dependency to DSP/ML computing services
```

### node_architecture  "name" 

Create a dependency of the execution of the node to a specific processor architecture. For example when the code is incorporating in-line assembly of a specific architecture.

Example:

```
   node_architecture    armv6m  ; a node made for Cortex-M0
```


### node_fpu_used "option" (TBD)

The command creates a dependency on the FPU capabilities
Example :

```
   node_fpu_used   0  ; fpu option used (default 0: none, no FPU assembly or intrinsic) 
```

### node_version    "n"

For information, the version of the node
Example :

```
 node_version    101            ; version of the computing node
```

### node_complexity_index    "n"

For information and debug to set a watchdog timer: the parameters give the maximum amount of cycles for the initialization of the node and the processing of a frame.
Example :

```
 node_complexity_index 1e5 1e6 ; maximum number of cycles at initialization time and execution of a frame
```

### node_dynamic_malloc

The node memory allocation is not pre-computer a graph compilation stages, but dynamically during the RESET sequence of the node. The scheduler starts the reset sequence asking for the number of bytes per memory segment (see node_mem "index"  below). It allocates the memory and restart the reset sequence with the pointers to physical memory.
Example :

```
 node_dynamic_malloc ; the node returns at reset time the amount of bytes per memory segment
```

### node_not_reentrant  

Information of reentrancy :  the node cannot be called again before it completes its previous execution. Default nodes are reentrant.
Example :

```
 node_not_reentrant ; one single instance of the node can be scheduled in the graph
```

### node_stream_version  "n"            

Version of the stream scheduler it is compatible with.
Example :

```
  node_stream_version    101
```

 

### node_logo  "file name" 

File name of the node logo picture (JPG/GIF format) to use in the GUI.

--------------------------------------

## Node memory allocation

A node can ask for **up to 6 memory banks** with tunable fields : 

- type (static, working/scratch, static with periodic backup)
- speed (normal, fast, critical fast)
- relocatable (the location can change after the node was notified)
- program / data 
- size in bytes

The size can be a simple number of bytes or a computed number coupled to a function of stream format parameters (number of channels, sampling rate, frame size) and a flexible parameter defined in the graph, here.
The total memory allocation size in bytes = 

```
   A + 							   fixed memory allocation in Bytes  
   B x frame_size(mono) of arc(i) or max(input/output arcs) or their sum   +
   C x frame_size(mono) x nb_channel of arc(j)   + 
   D x nb_channels of arc(k)   +     
   parameter from the graph        optional field "node_malloc_add" 

```

The first memory block is the node instance, followed by other blocks. This first block has the index #0.

### node_mem "index"           

The command is used to start a memory block declaration with the index in the parameter.
Example :

```
 node_mem 0    ; starts the declaration section of memory block #0 (its instance)
```

### node_mem_alloc  "A"

The parameter gives the "A" value of additional memory allocation in Bytes.
Example :

```
node_mem_alloc  32    ; add 32 bytes to the current node_mem
```

### node_mem_frame_size_mono "B" "type" ("i")   

Declaration of extra memory in proportion with the mono frame size of the stream flowing through a specified arc index. 

- t = arc : tells the index of arc to consider is "i"
- t = maxin : tells to take the maximum of all input arcs
- t = maxout : the maximum of all output arcs
- t = maxall : the maximum of all arcs
- t = sumin : the sum of frame size of all input arcs
- t = sumout : the sum of frame size of all output arcs
- t = sumall : the sum of frame size of all arcs

Example :

```
node_mem_frame_size_mono 2 maxin   ; declare the 2x maximum size of all input arcs
node_mem_frame_size_mono 5.3 arc 0 ;   add 5.3x mono frame size of arc #0
```

### node_mem_frame_size "C" "type" ("j")   

Declaration of extra memory in proportion with the multichannel frame size of the stream flowing through a specified arc index. 

```
node_mem_frame_size 2 arc 0 ; declare the 2x multichannel frame size of arc #0
```

### node_mem_nbchan "D" "type" ("k")

Declaration of extra memory in proportion to the number of channel of arcs 

```
node_mem_nbchan 44 maxin ; add 44 x maximum nb of channels of input arcs
```

### node_mem_alignment "n"

Declaration of the memory Byte alignment
Example :

```
node_mem_alignement     4           ; 4 bytes to (default) ` 
```

### node_mem_type "n"

Definition of the dynamic characteristics of the memory block :

0 STATIC : memory content is preserved between two calls (default )

1 WORKING : scratch memory content is not preserved between two calls 

2 PERIODIC_BACKUP static memory to reload during a warm reboot 

3 PSEUDO_WORKING static only during the uncompleted execution state of the NODE

Example :

```
node_mem_type 3   ; memory block put in a backup memory area when possible
```

### node_mem_speed "n"

Declaration of the memory desired for the memory block.

0 for 'best effort' or 'no constraint' on speed access

1 for 'fast' memory selection when possible

2 for 'critical fast' section, to be in I/DTCM when available

Example :

```
node_mem_speed 0   ; relax speed constraint for this block
```

### node_mem_relocatable "0/1"

Declares if the pointer to this memory block is relocatable, or assigned a fixed address at reset (default, parameter = '0').
When the memory block is relocatable a command 'STREAM_UPDATE_RELOCATABLE' is used with address changes:  void (node) (command, .. ); This is done with the associated script of the node (TBD).

Example :

```
node_mem_relocatable    1   ; the address of the block can change
```

### node_mem_data0prog1 "0/1"

This command tells if the memory will be used for data or program accesses. Default is '0' for data access. 

The RAM program memory segments are loaded by the node. When the memory allocation is not possible the address shared to the node will be (uint32) (-1).

Example :

```
  node_mem_data0prog1  1 ; program memory block 
```

--------------------------------------

## Configuration of the arcs attached to the node

The arc configuration gives the list of compatible options possible for the node processing. Some options are described as a list, or as a range of values. 
The syntax is : an index and the list of numbers within brackets "{" and "}". The index gives the default value to consider in the list. Index "1" corresponds to the first element of the list.
Index value "0" means "any value". The list can be empty in that case.

Example of an option list between five values, the index is 2 meaning the default value is the second in the list (value = 6).
`   { 2  5 6 7 8 9 } ` 
When the index is negative the list is decoded as a "range". A Range is a set of three numbers : 

- the first option
- the step to the next possible option
- the last (included) option

The absolute index value selects the default value in this range.

Example of is an option list of values (1, 1.2, 1.4, 1.6, 1.8, .. , 4.2), the index is -3 meaning the default value is the third in the list (value = 1.4).

```
  { -3  1  0.2  4.2 } 
```

### node_arc "n"

The command starts the declaration of a new arc, followed by its index used when connecting two nodes.
Example :

```
   node_arc 2    ; start the declaration of a new arc with index 2
```

Implementation comment : all the nodes have at least one arc on the transmit side used to manage the node's locking field.

### node_arc_name "name"

Name of the arc used in the GUI.
Example: 

```
    node_arc_name filter_output  ; "filter_output" is the name of the arc
```

### node_arc_rx0tx1 "0/1"

Declares the direction of the arc from the node point of view : "0" means a stream is received  through this arc, "1" means the arc is used to push a stream of procesed data.

```
    node_arc_rx0tx1             0               ; followed by 0:input 1:output, default = 0 and 1
```

### node_arc_interleaving  "0/1"

Arc data stream interleaving scheme: "0" for no interleaving (independent data frames per channel), "1" for data interleaving at raw-samples levels.
Example :

```
    node_arc_interleaving 0     data is deinterleaved on this arc
```

### node_arc_nb_channels  "n"

Number of the channels possible for this arc (default is 1).
Example :

```
    node_arc_nb_channels {1 1 2}  ; options for the number of channels is mono or stereo
```

### node_arc_units_scale "unit" "scale"

Command used when the node needs the streams to be rescaled to absolute scaled units (See paragraph "Units" of [Units](#Units)).

```
    node_arc_units_scale VRMS  0.15  ; full-scale is equivalent to 0.15 VRMS
```

### node_arc_units_scale_multiple "unit" "scale"

Command used when the node needs the streams to be rescaled to absolute scaled units and there are multiple units in sequence (See paragraph "Units" of [Units](#Units)).

```
    node_arc_units_scale_multiple DPS 360 GAUSS 0.002 
    ; interleaved format with maximum 360 dps and 0.002 Gauss
```

### node_arc_raw_format "f"

Raw samples data format for read/write and arithmetic's operations. The stream in the "2D domain" are defining other sub-format 
Example :

```
    node_arc_raw_format {1 3 1} raw format options: STREAM_S16, STREAM_FP32, default values S16
```

### node_arc_frame_samples "n"

Frame size options in samples,

```
 node_arc_frame_samples  {-1 1 1 160} ; options of possible frame_size in number of sample (which can mono or multi-channel) 
```

### node_arc_frame_duration "t"

Duration of the frame in milliseconds. The translation to frame length in Bytes is made during the compilation of the graph from the sampling-rate and the number of channels. 
A value "0" means "any duration" which is the default.
Example :

```
node_arc_frame_duration {1 10 22.5}  frame of 10ms (default) or 22.5ms
```

### node_arc_sampling_rate "fs"

Declaration of the allowed options for the node_arc_sampling_rate in Hertz.
Example :

```
node_arc_sampling_rate {1 16000 44100} ; sampling rate options, 16kHz is the default value if not specified 
```

### node_arc_sampling_period_s  "T"

Duration of the frame in seconds. The translation to frame length in Bytes is made during the compilation of the graph from the sampling-rate and the number of channels. 
A value "0" means "any duration" which is the default.
Example :

```
node_arc_sampling_period_s {-2 0.1 0.1 1}  frame sampling going from 100ms to 1000ms, with default 200ms
```

### node_arc_sampling_period_day "D"

Duration of the frame in days. The translation to frame length in Bytes is made during the compilation of the graph from the sampling-rate and the number of channels. 
A value "0" means "any duration" which is the default.
Example :

```
node_arc_sampling_period_day {-2 1 1 30}  frame sampling going from 1 day to 1 month with steps of 1 day.
```

### node_arc_sampling_accuracy  "p"

When a node does not need the input data to be rate-accurate, this command allows some rate flexibility without the need for the insertion of a synchronous rate converter.
The command parameter is in percent.
Example :

```
node_arc_sampling_accuracy  0.1  ; sampling rate accuracy is 0.1%
```


### node_arc_inPlaceProcessing  "in out"

Memory optimization with arc buffer overlay. This command tells the "in" arc index is overlaid with the "out" arc index. The default configuration is to allocate different memory for input and output arcs. 
The arc descriptors are different but the base address of the buffers are identical.
Example :

```
node_arc_inPlaceProcessing  1 2   ; in-place processing can be made between arc 1 and 2
```

--------------------------------------

# Node design

All the programs can be used with the Graph-scheduler (also called computing "nodes") as soon as a minimal amount of description is given in a "manifest" and the program can be used through a single entry point with a wrapper using the prototype :

```
void (node) (uint32_t command, stream_handle_t instance, stream_xdmbuffer_t *data, uint32_t *state);
```

Where "command" tells to reset, run, set parameters, ..  "instance" is an opaque access to the static area of the node, "data" is a table of pointers+size pairs of all the arcs used by the node, and "state" returns information of computing completion of the subroutine for the data being shared through the arcs.

During "reset" sequence of the graph the node are initialized. Nothing prevents a node to call the standard library for memory allocations or math computing. But the context of the graph interpreter is Embedded IoT, with extreme optimization for costs and power consumption. 

--------------------------------------

## General recommendations

General programming guidelines of Node : 

- Nodes must be C callable, or any other language respecting the EABI.
- Nodes are reentrant, or if not this must be mentioned in the manifest.
- Data are treated as little endian by default.
- Data references are relocatable, there is no “hard-coded” data memory locations.
- All Node code must be fully relocatable: there cannot be hard coded program memory locations.
- Nodes are independent of any particular I/O peripheral, there is no hard coded address.
- Nodes are characterized by their memory, and MIPS requirements when possible (with respect to buffer length to process).
- Nodes must characterize their ROM-ability; i.e., state whether or not they are ROM-able (no self-modifying code unless documented so).
- Run-time object creation should be avoid : memory reservation should be done once during the initialization step.
- Nodes are managing buffers with pointer using physical addresses and shared in the parameters.
- Processors have no MMU : there is no mean of mapping physically non-contiguous segments into a contiguous block.
- Cache coherency is managed in Graph-Interpreter at transitions from one node to the next one.
- Nodes should not use stack allocated buffers as the source or destination of any graph services for memory transfer.
- Static/persistent data, retention data used for warm-boot, scratch data, stack and heap usage will be documented.
- Manifest is detailing the memory allocation section with respect to latency/speed requirements. 



## Node parameters

A node is using the following prototype 

```
void (node) (uint32_t command, void *instance, void *data, uint32_t *state);
```

With following parameters: 

| Parameter name | Details         | Types                                                        |
| :------------- | :-------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| command        | input parameter | uint32_t                                                     |
| instance       | instance        | void * casted to the node type                               |
| data           | input data      | casted pointer to struct stream_xdmbuffer { int address;  int size; } |
| state          | returned state  | uint32_t *                                                   |

### Command parameter

Command bit-fields :

| Bit-fields | Name     | Details                                                      |
| :--------- | :------- | :----------------------------------------------------------- |
| 31-24      | reserved |                                                              |
| 16-23      | node tag | different roles depending on the command. With "set parameter" it gives the index of the parameter to update from the data* address  (if 0 then all the parameters are prepared in data*) |
| 15-12      | preset   | the node can define 16 "presets", preconfigured sets of parameters |
| 11-5       | reserved |                                                              |
| 4          | extended | set to 1 for a reset command with warm boot : static areas need to be initialized except the memory segments assigned to a retention memory in the manifest. When the processor has no retention memory those static areas area cleared by the scheduler. |
| 3-0 (LSB)  | command  | 1: reset</br> 2: set parameter</br> 3: read parameter</br>4: run</br>5: stop</br>6: update the physical address of a relocatable memory segment</br> |

### Instance

Instance is an opaque memory pointer (void *) to the main static area of the node. The memory alignment requirement is specified in the node manifest. 

### Data

The multichannel data field is a pointer of arcs' data. This is pointer to list of structures of two "INTPTR_T" (32bits or 64bits wide depending on the processor architecture). The first INTPTR_T is a pointer to the data, the second tells the number of bytes to process (for an input arc) or the number of bytes available in the buffer (for output arcs). 

A node can have **16 arcs**. Each of them can have individual format (number of channels, frame length, interleaving scheme, raw sample type, sampling rate, time-stamps). Arcs can be used for other purpose than data stream,  like parameter storage.

### Status

Nodes return state is "0" unless the data processing is not finished, then the returned status of "1".



## Node calling sequence

The nodes are first called with the command *reset* followed by *set parameters*, several *run* commands and finally *stop* to release memory. This paragraph details the content of the parameters of the node during "reset", "set parameter" and "run" :

```
void (node) (uint32_t command, void *instance, void *data, uint32_t *state); 
```

### Reset command

Each Node is define by an index on 10 bits and a "synchronization Byte" with 3-bits defining the architecture it made for (from 1 to 7, "0" means any architecture), 3-Bits defining the processor index within this architecture (from 1 to 7, "0" means any processor), and 2-bits for thread instance ("0" means any thread, "1, 2, 3" respectively for low-latency, normal latency, and background tasks. At reset time processor 1, of architecture 1 is allowed to copy the graph from Flash to RAM and unlock the others.

Then each processor parses the graph looking nodes associated to him, resets it and updates the parameters from graph data. When all the nodes have been set the application is notified and the graph switches to "run" mode. Each graph scheduler instance takes care input and output streams are not blocked : each IOs is associated to a processor. Most of the time a single processor is in charge of all.

The multiprocessor synchronization mechanisms are abstracted outside of the graph interpreter (in the platform abstraction layer), a software-based lock is proposed by default.

**The second parameter "instance"** is a pointer to the list of memory banks reserved by the scheduler for the node, in the same sequence order of the declarations made in the node manifest. The first element of the list is the instance of the node, followed by the pointers to the data (or program) memory reservations.

**The third parameter "data"** is used to share the address of function providing computing services. 

### Set Parameter command 

TBC

The bit-field "Node Tag" tells which (or all) parameter will be updated.

**The third parameter "data"** is a pointer to the new parameters.

### Run command

The bit-field "Node Tag" tells which (or all) parameter will be updated.

**The third parameter "data"** is a pointer to the list buffer ("struct stream_xdmbuffer { int address;  int size; }") associated to each arc connected to the node.



## Test-bench and non-regression test-patterns

Nodes are delivered with a test-bench (code and non-regression database).

## Conformance checks

Purpose: create an automatic process to incorporate new NODE in a large repository and have a scalable mean to check conformance: 

- verification of the conformance to the APIs
- injection of typical and non-typical data aligned with NODE description
- check of outbound parameter behavior
- check of stack consumption and memory leakage.

## Services provided to the nodes 

The "service" function has the following prototype

```
typedef void    (services) (uint32_t service_command, uint8_t *ptr1, uint8_t *ptr2, uint8_t *ptr3, uint32_t n); 
```

# Graph design

The Graph-Interpreter is scheduling a linked-list of computing nodes interconnected with arcs. Nodes descriptors tell which processor can execute the code, which arc it is connected to. The arcs descriptors tell the base address of the buffers, read/write indexes, debug/trace information to log and a flag to tell the consumer node to wrap data to the base addresses. The buffers base address are portable using 6-bits "offset" and 22-bits "index". The offset is translated by each graph interpreter instance of each processor in a physical address given in the Platform-Manifest. 

The graph is placed in a shared memory for all processors, there is no message passing scheme, the Graph-Interpreter scheduler’s instances and doing the same estimations in parallel, deciding which node needs to be executed in priority. 



A graph text has several sections :

- **Control of the scheduler** : debug option, location of the graph in memory
- **File paths** : to easily incorporate sections of data “included” with files
- **Formats** : most of the arcs are using the same frame length and sampling rate, to avoid repeating the same information the formats are grouped in a table and referenced by indexes
- The **IOs or boundaries of the graph** : the IOs are a kind of arcs producing or consuming a stream of data
- The **scripts** are byte-code interpreted programs used for simple operations like setting parameters, sharing debug information, calling “callbacks” predefined in the application.
- The list of **nodes** ("linked-list" of nodes), without their connexions with other nodes. This section defines also the boot parameters, the memory mapping
- The list of **arcs**, their relations with two nodes and the minimal type of debug activity on data moves

## **Binary format of the graph**

## Graph: control of the scheduler

The first words of the binary graph give the portion of the graph to move to RAM.
To have addresses portability of addresses between processors, the graph interpreter is managing a list of "memory-offsets".
Every physical address is computed from a 28 bit-field structure made of : 6 bits used to select maximum 64 memory-offsets (or memory bank). And a 22bits field used as an index in this memory bank.
The function "platform_init_stream_instance()" initializes the interpreter memory-offset table.

### graph_locations  "x"

There are seven parameters corresponding to the seven graph memory sections (below). Each is associated with a code "x" :  -1 means "this section of the graph stays and is used from here, as-is",  otherwise it means "memory bank ID 'x' will be used for this information segment of the graph and it will be moved to before execution". 

```
GRAPH_PIO_HW        0
GRAPH_PIO_GRAPH     1
GRAPH_SCRIPTS       2
GRAPH_LINKED_LIST   3
GRAPH_ONGOING       4
GRAPH_FORMATS       5
GRAPH_ARCS          6
```

Example describing the default assignments : all segments stay in the original graph except the last three 

```
graph_locations -1 -1 -1 -1 0 0 0 ; 4 segments stay in Flash, others go in RAMID 0
```

### debug_script_fields "x"

The parameter is a bit-field of flags controlling the scheduler loop :

- bit 0 (lsb 1) set means "call the debug/trace script before each node is called"
- bit 1 (2) set means "call the debug script after each node is called"
- bit 2 (4) set means "call the debug script at the end of the loop"
- bit 3 (8) set means "call the debug script when starting the graph scheduling"
- bit 4 (16) set means "call the debug script when returning from the graph scheduling"
- no bit is set (default) the debug script is not called 

Example :

```
debug_script_fields 0	; no debug script activated
```

### scheduler_return "x"

- 1: return to application caller subroutines after each node execution calls
- 2: return to caller once all node of the graph are parsed
- 3: return to caller when all nodes are starving (default 3)

Example :

```
scheduler_return 1
```

### allowed_processors "x"

bit-field of the processors allowed to execute this graph, (default = 1 main processor)

Example :

```
allowed_processors 0x81	; (10000001) processor ID 1 and 8 can read the graph
```

### graph_file_path "index"  "path"

Index and its file path, used when including files (sub graphs, parameter files and scripts).

Example :

```
graph_file_path 2  ../nodes/   ; file path index 2 to the folder ../nodes
```

### graph_memory_bank "x"

Command used in the context of memory mapping tuning.
"x" : index of the memory bank indexes where to map the graph (default 0).

Example :

```
graph_memory_bank 1   ; select of memory bank 1 of the Platform manifest
```

-----------------------------------------

## Graph: IO control and stream data formats

There are three data declared in the graph scheduler instance (*arm_stream_instance_t*):
A - a pointer to a RAM area giving 

   - on-going transfer flags
   - debug area of arcs

B - a pointer to the list of IOs bit-fields controlling the setting of the IO, the content of which depends on the *Domain*:

   - the index of the arc creating the interface between the IO and a node of the graph ("arcID")
   - the Rx/Tx direction of the stream, from the point of view of the graph
   - the dynamic behavior : data polling initiated by the scheduler or transfer initiated outside of the graph
   - flag telling if the data are copied in the arc's buffer or if the arc's descriptor is modified to point directly to the data
   - flag telling if the buffer used by the IO interface must be reserved by the graph compiler 
   - physical Domain of the data (see command "format_domain")
   - index to the Abstraction Layer in charge of operating the transfers
   - for audio  (mixed-signal setting, gains, sampling-rate, ..)

C - a pointer to the "Formats" which are structures of four words giving :

 - word 0 : frame size 4MB (Byte accurate) 
 - word 1 : number of channels (1..32), interleaving scheme, time-stamp, raw format, domain, sub-type, frame size extension (up to 64GB +/-16kB)
 - word 2 : sampling rate in [Hz], truncated IEEE FP32 on 24bits : S_E8_M15 
 - word 3 : specific to each domain (audio and motion channel mapping, image format and border)


### format_index "n"            

This command starts the declaration of a new format.

```
format_index 2 ; all further details are for format index 2
```

index used to start the declaration of a new format

### format_raw_data "n"

The parameter is the raw data code of the table below.

```
format_raw_data 3 ; raw data is "signed integers of 16bits" 
```

The default index is 3 : STREAM_16 (see Annexe "Data Types").

### format_frame_length "n"          

Frame length in number of bytes of the current format declaration (default :1)

```
format_frame_length 160
```

### format_nbchan "n"

Number of channels in the stream (default 1)

```
format_nbchan 2 ; stereo format 
```

### format_sampling_rate "u f"

Sampling rate in unit "u": hertz, bpm (beats per minute), rpm (rotation per minute)

```
format_sampling_rate hertz 1e-3  ;   1mHz
```

### format_sampling_period "u t"

Sampling unit "u" : second, minute, hour, day

```
format_sampling_period hour 12  ;   period of 12 hours
```

### format_interleaving "n" 

```
format_interleaving 0
```

0 means interleaved raw data, 1 means deinterleaved data by packets of "frame size"

### format_time_stamp "n"

```
format_time_stamp 0 ; no time-stamp
```

time-stamp format :

- 0: no time stamp
- 1: simple counter
- 2: time difference in second (float)
- 3: time distance from Unix Epoch (double)

### format_domain "n"

Usage context of this command is for the section "B" of above chapter "IO control and stream data formats".
Example `format_domain 2   ; this format uses specific details of audio out domain `

| DOMAIN            | CODE   | COMMENTS                                                     |

-----------------------------------------

## Graph: interfaces of the graph

### stream_io_graph "n H" 

This command starts a section for the declaration of IO "n". The parameter is the interface index used later in the graph. The  next parameter is the physical interface given in platform manifests 

Example 

```
    stream_io_graph 2 18	; the graph IO number 2 is connect ed to the HW 18
```

### stream_io_format "n" 

Parameter: index to the table of formats (default #0)
Example 

```
    stream_io_format 0 
```

### stream_io_setting "W1 W2 W3"

"IO settings" is a bit-field structure, specific to the IO domain, placed at the beginning of the binary graph, and used during the initialization sequence of the graph.
See also [IO Controls Bit-fields per domain](#IO-Controls-Bit-fields-per-domain)

Example

```
stream_io_setting 7812440 0 ; 0=default restting at reset
```

### stream_io_setting_callback "X" "Y" 

Initializes the IO using a platform callback.  Example 

```
 stream_io_setting_callback 6 7812440 ; Use the platform io_setting callback for the 
;	current stream_io_graph using parameters 6 7812440 
```

-----------------------------------------

## Graph: memory mapping 

Split the memory mapping to ease memory overlays between nodes and arcs by defining new memory-offset index ("ID"). Other use-case: split the TCM memory between the LOWLATENCYTASKS and the others.

Format : ID, new ID to use in the node/arc declarations, byte offset within the original ID, length of the new memory offset.

```
;              original_id  new_id    start   length 
memory_mapping      2        100      1024    32700 
```

### Memory fill

Filling of a word32 pattern after the arc descriptors 


```
    mem_fill_pattern 5 3355AAFF   memory fill 5 word32 value 0x3355AAFF (total 20 Bytes)
```

-----------------------------------------

## Graph: subgraphs 

(To be defined)

A subgraph is equivalent to program subroutines for graphs. A subgraph can be reused in several places in the graph or in other subgraph.
The graph compiler creates references by name mangling from the call hierarchy. A subgraph receives indexes of IO streams and memory bank indexes for tuning the memory map.
The caller gives its indexes of the arcs to use in the subgraph, and the memory mapping offset indexes. 
Example :

```
    subgraph 
       sub1                        ; subgraph name, used for name mangling

## Graph: nodes declarations

Nodes are declared with their name and respective instance index in the graph (or subgraph). 
The system integrator can set a "preset" (pre-tuned list of parameters described on node's documentation) and node-specific parameters to load at boot-time.
The address offset of the nodes is provided as a result of the graph compilation step.
Declaration syntax example : 

```
    node arm_stream_filter  0  ; first instance of the nore "arm_stream_filter" 
```

### node_preset "n"

The system intgrator can select 16 "presets" when using a node, each corresponding to a configuration of the node (see its documentation). 
The Preset value is with RESET and SET_PARAMETER commands, the default value is 0.
Example : 

```
    node_preset              1      ; parameter preset used at boot time 
```

### node_malloc_add "A s"

Adds and extra number of bytes "A" to the "node_mem" segment index "s".
Example : 

```
    node_malloc_add 12 0  ; add 12 bytes to segment 0
```

### node_map_hwblock "m" "o"

This command is used to tune the memory mapping and bypass the speed requirement of the node manifest. It tells to force the memory segment index given in the first parameter to be mapped to the memory offset index of the second parameter.
Example : 

```
    node_map_hwblock 0 2 ; memory segment 0 is mapped to bank offset 2 
```

### node_map_swap "m" "o"

This command is used to optimize the memory mapping of small and fast memory segment by swapping, a memory segment content from another memory offset (usually a slower one).  
Usage : 

```
 node_map_swap 1 0 ; swap node memory segment 1 to a memory area of offset 0
```

In the above both cases the memory segment 1 is copied (next is swapped) from offset memory segment 0 (a dummy arc descriptor is created to access this temporary area) before code execution. 

### node_trace_id "io"

Selection of the graph IO interface used for sending the debug and trace information.
Example : 

```  
    node_trace_id  0      ; IO port 0 is used to send the trace 
```

### node_map_proc, node_map_arch, node_map_thread

The graph can be executed in a multiprocessor and multi tasks platform. Those commands allow the graph interpreter scheduler to skip the nodes not associated to the current processor / architecture and task.
The platform can define 7 architectures and 7 processors. When the parameter is not defined (or with value 0) the scheduler interprets it as "any processor" or "any architecture" can execute this node.
Several OS threads can interpret the graph at the same time. A parameter "0" means any thread can execute this node, and the value "1" is associated to low-latency tasks, "3" to background tasks. 
Examples :

```
node_map_proc 2 	; the node will only be executed on processor 2
```

### node_memory_isolation  "0/1"

Activate (parameter "1") the processor memory protection unit (on code, private memory allocated segments, and stack) during the execution of this node. 
Example : 

```
   node_memory_isolation 1 ; activation of the memory protection unit (MPU), default 0 
```

### node_memory_clear "m"

Debug feature: clear the memory bank "m" before and after the execution of the node.  
Example : 

```
   node_memory_clear 2 ; clear the bank 2 from manifest before and after execution 
```

### node_script "index" 

The indexed script is executed before and after the node execution. The conditional flag is set on the first call and cleared before calling the following calls.
Example :

```
  node_script 12 ; call script #12 associated to this node
```

### node_user_key "k64"

The 64bits key is sent to the node during the reset sequence, It is placed after the memory allocation pointers. 

The node receives the "node_key" from the scheduler and this "user_key" to decide the features to activate.

Example :

```
  node_user_key 101447945804525706  64 bits key
```

### node_parameters "tag"

This command declares the parameters to share with the node during the RESET sequence. If the "tag" parameter is null is tells the following parameters is a full set. Otherwise it is an index of a subset defined in the node documentation.
The following declaration is a list of data terminated with the "end".
Example of a packed structure of 22 bytes of parameters:

```
     node_parameters     0                   TAG = "all parameters" 
         1  u8;  2                           Two biquads 
         1  u8;  1                           postShift 
         5 s16; 681   422   681 23853 -15161 elliptic band-pass 1450..1900/16kHz 
         5 s16; 681 -1342   681 26261 -15331 
     end 
```

-----------------------------------------

## Graph Scripts byte codes

Scripts are interpreted byte-codes designed for control and calls to the graph scheduler for node control and parameter settings. Scripts are declared as standard nodes with extra parameters to declare memory size and allowing it to be reused for several scripts. The script-nodes have the transmit arc used to hold the instance memory (registers, stack and heap memory).

The virtual engine has 20 instructions and up to 10 registers. 

There are two formats of instructions:

- test and load : [test field] [register to test or to load] [ALU  operation] [ALU operands]

- jump and special operations : calls, scatter/gather load, bit-field operations

### Test instructions

The result of the test is evaluated by adding  a conditional field to any instruction :

```
List of test instructions :

test_equ	     test if equal
test_leq	     test if less or equal
test_lt 	     test if lower
test_neq	     test if non equal
test_geq	     test if great or equal
test_gt 	     test if greater

test the result :
if_yes ...
if_no ...
```

### Arithmetic operations

```
add   		addition of two operands
sub   		substraction
mul   		multiplication
div   		division
or    		logical OR,  FP32 operands are pre-converted to "int"
nor   		logical NOR
and   		logical AND
xor   		logical XOR
shr   		shift right, sign extension applied on "signed" registers
shl   		shift left
set   		set a bit
clr   		clear a bit
max   		compute the maximum of two operands
min   		minimum
amax  		maximum of absolute values
amin  		minmum of absolute values
norm  		normalize to MSB and return the amount of shifts
addmod		addition with modulo defined by "base" and "size"
submod		subtraction with modulo
```

The 10 registers of the virtual machine are "r0" .. "r9". Using "sp0" (or simply "sp") means an access to the data located at the stack pointer position, "sp1" tells to increment the stack pointer **SP** after a write to the stack and to decrement it after a read. In case several stack accesses are made in the same instruction the update of the stack pointer are made when reading the instructions from right to left.

For example : ` sp1 = add sp1 #float 3.14 `  : the literal constant "3.14" is added to the data on top of the stack and SP is post-decremented after the read ("pop" operation), the result of the addition is saved on the stack ("push") with SP post-incremented. ` sp1 = add sp0 sp1 ` pops the stack adds the next stack value (without SP decrement) and the result is pushed.

```
r6 = 3                    r6 = 3  (the default litterals type is int32)
r11 = sp                  read data from the top of the stack 
r6 = add r5 3             r6 = ( r5 + 3 )
sp1 = r6                  push the result on stack (SP incremented)
test_eq r6 sub r5 r4      test if r6 == ( r5 - r4 )
if_yes r6 = add r5 3      conditional addition of r5 with 3 saved in r6
```

Literal constants are signed integers by default, if other data types are needed the constant is preceded by "#float" or "uint8", for example :

```
r3 = 3.14159              load PI in r3
r4 = mul r3 12.0          floating-point multiplication saved in r4
```

Other instructions examples :

```
swap r2 sp1               swap r2 with the top of the stack, pop it
label L1                  label declaration
if_not call L1            conditional call 
banz L1 r2                decrement r2 and branch if not zero
jump L1 r1                jump to label and push up to 2 registers 
call L1 r2 r3             call a subroutine and push 2 registers
set r4 #uint32            cast r4 as an unsigned integer
set r4 #heap L2           load r4 with an address in the heap RAM
set r4 base L2            set the base address of a circular buffer
set r4 size 12            set the size of a circular buffer
set r0 graph node_name_2  set r0 with the graph's node instance #2
save r4 r5 r0 r2 r11      push 5 registers on the stack
restore r4 r5             pop 2 registers from the stack
delete 4                  remove the last 4 registers from the stack
[ r4  12 ]+ =  r5         scatter load with pre-increment
r3 = [ r4 ]  r0           gather load 
r3 | 8 15 | = r2          bit-field load of r2 to the 2nd byte of r3
r3 = r2 | 0 7 |           bit-field extract the LSB of r2 to r3
return                    return from subroutine or script
Syscall 1 r1 r4 r5        system call (below)
```

    end                                                      
```

### System calls

The `"Syscall"` instruction gives access to nodes (set/read parameters) and arc (read/write data). It allows the access to other system information: 

- FIFO content (read/write), filling status and access to the arc debug information (last time-stamp access, average of samples, etc ..)
- Node parameters read and update, with / without a reset of the node
- Basic compute and data move functions
- The call-backs provided by the application (use-case, change the graph IO parameters, debug and trace)

#### Syscall syntax

Syscall instructions have five parameters 

```
syscall index command param1 param2 param3
```



| Syscall index                    | register parameters                                          |

## GUI design tool

The compiled binary graph can be generated with graphical tool (prototyped in "stream_tools\gui"). The tool creates the compiled binary format and the intermediate text file for later manual tuning.

## Arcs of the graph

The syntax is different for arcs connected to the boundary of the graph, and arcs placed between two nodes.
Depending on real-time behaviors (CPU load and jitter, task priorities, speed of data streams) the data can be processed in-place (large input images for examples) or it can be mandatory to copy the data in temporary FIFO before being processed in the graph.
The parameter "set0copy1" is set to 0 (default value) for a processing made "in-place" : the base address the arc FIFO descriptor is modified during the transfer acknowledgment subroutine `arm_graph_interpreter_io_ack()` to point directly to the IO data (no data move).
When the parameter is 1 the data is copied in the arc FIFO. The graph compiler will allocate an amount of memory corresponding to a frame length.

Example :

```
; Syntax :
; arc_input   { io / set0copy1 / fmtProd } + { node / inst / arc / fmtCons }
; arc_output  { io / set0copy1 / fmtCons } + { node / inst / arc / fmtProd }
; arc  { node1 / inst / arc / fmtProd } + { node2 / inst / arc / fmtCons }

 arc_input 4 1 0    xxfilter 6 0 8   ; IO-4 sends data to the node xxfilter                            
                                                                      
; output arc from node xxdetector instance 5 output #1 using format #2 
;            to graph IO 7 using set0copy1=0 and format #9             
 arc_output 5 1 2   xxdetector 5 1 2                                   
                                                                      
;  arc between nodeAAA instance 1 output #2 using format #0             
;      and nodeBBB instance 3 output #4 using format #1                 
 arc nodeAAA 1 2 0   nodeBBB 3 4 1                                    
```

### arc_input 

A declaration of a graph input gives the name of the index of the stream which is the "producer" and the node it is connected to (the "consumer").

- index of the IO (see [stream_io](#stream_io))
- 0 or 1 to indicate the data is consumed "in-place" (parameter =0), or will be copied in the buffer associated to the arc (parameter =1). When the data is processed in-place the graph declares an arc descriptor without buffer, the function `void arm_stream_io_ack()` will copy the address of the data in the base address of the arc descriptor
- format ID (see [format "n"](#format-"n"))  used to produce the stream
- name of the consumer node 
- Instance index of the node, starting from 0
- arc index of the node (see [node_arc "n"](#node-arc="n"))
- format ID (see [format "n"](#format-"n"))  used to by the node consumer of the stream
- optional information to tell this arc is managed with "high quality of service" (HQoS) : the node consuming the stream will treat the corresponding processing with the highest priority whatever the content of the other arc connected to this node. This consumer node will arrange with data interpolations to let the HQoS stream be processed first with the lowest latency.

Example

``` 
arc_input   1 0 3 arm_stream_filter   4 0 6 
; 1 input stream from io 1
; 0 set the pointer to IO buffer without copy
; 3 third format used 
; arm_stream_filter receives the data
; 4 fifth instance of the node in the graph
; 0 arc index of the node connected to the stream (node input)
; 6 stream is consumed using the seventh format
```

### arc_output 

A declaration of a graph output gives the name of the index of the stream which is the "consumer" and the node it is connected to (the "producer").

Example

```
arc_output   1 1 3 arm_stream_filter   4 1 0
; 1 output stream from io 1
; 1 copy the data from the arc buffer 
; 3 third format used 
; arm_stream_filter produces the data
; 4 fifth instance of the node in the graph
; 1 arc index of the node connected to the stream (node output)
; 0 stream is generated using the first format
```

### arc_nodes node1 - node2

Declaration of an arc between two nodes.

Example

``` 
arc_nodes arm_stream_filter 4 1 0 sigp_stream_detector 0 0 1   H
; arm_stream_filter produces the data to the sigp_stream_detector
; 4 fifth instance of the node in the graph
; 1 arc index of the node connected to the stream (node output)
; 0 stream is generated using the first format
; sigp_stream_detector consumes the data
; 0 first instance of the node in the graph
; 0 arc index of the node connected to the stream (node input)
; 1 stream is consumed using the second format
; 'H' tells to process the stream with priority 
```

### arc flow control RD WR

Flow error management with arc descriptor bits bits FLOW_RD_ARCW2 / FLOW_WR_ARCW2, to let an arc stay with 25% .. 75% of data. Process done in "router" node when using HQOS arc and IO master interfaces

The arc is initialized with 50% of null data. The processing is frame-based, there are minimum 3 frames in the buffer.

When a IO-master writes in an arc with FLOW_WR_ARCW2=1 and the arc is full at +75%, the new data 
    is extrapolated and the arc stays at 75% full 

```
  buffer full after NewData was push by the IO-master
  Buff  xxxxxxxx|xxxx|xxxx|xxxx|bbbb|aaaa|  
          R_ptr                      W_ptr
The previous frame (bbb) is filled (bbb x win_rampDown) + (newData_aaa x win_rampUp) W_ptr steps back 
        xxxxxxxx|xxxx|xxxx|xxxx|bbaa|----|  buffer full
          R_ptr                      W_ptr
```

When a IO-master read from an arc with FLOW_RD_ARCW2=1 and the arc is empty at -25%, the new data 
    is extrapolated and the arc stays at 25% empty

```
  Buff  |bbbb| is read by the IO-master
  buffer hold only ONE frame |aaaa| after the previous read
        |bbbb|aaaa|----|  
              R_ptr W_ptr
  The previous frame (bbb) is filled (aaa x win_rampDown) + (bbb x win_rampUp) and R_ptr steps back
        |aabb|aaaa|----|  bbbb
         R_ptr      W_ptr
```

Activation of the error flow management bits on read and write access:

``` 
arc_flow_error  1 1 ; read write  
```

### arc debug

Each arc descriptor can be configured to have an operation (in a list of 32) implemented with result returned in a dedicated memory section of the graph.

| CODE | DEBUG OPERATION                                              |
| ---- | :----------------------------------------------------------- |
| 0    | no operation                                                 |
| 1    | increment DEBUG_REG_ARCW1 with the number of RAW samples     |
| 2    | set a 0 in to *DEBUG_REG_ARCW1, 5 MSB gives the bit to clear |
| 3    | set a 1 in to *DEBUG_REG_ARCW1, 5 MSB gives the bit to set   |
| 4    | increment *DEBUG_REG_ARCW1                                   |
| 5    |                                                              |
| 6    | call-back in the application side, data rate estimate in DEBUG_REG_ARCW1 |
| 7    | second call-back : wake-up processor from DEBUG_REG_ARCW1=[ProcID, command] |
| 8    |                                                              |
| 9    | time_stamp_last_access                                       |
| 10   | peak with forgeting factor 1/256 in DEBUG_REG_ARCW1          |
| 11   | mean with forgeting factor 1/256 in DEBUG_REG_ARCW1          |
| 12   | min with forgeting factor 1/256 in DEBUG_REG_ARCW1           |
| 13   | absmin with forgeting factor 1/256 in DEBUG_REG_ARCW1        |
| 14   | when data is changing the new data is push to another arc DEBUG_REG_ARCW1=[ArcID] |
| 15   | automatic rewind read/write                                  |

Example :

```
    arc_debug_cmd  1  debug action "ARC_INCREMENT_REG"         
    arc_debug_reg  3  index of the 64bits result, default = #0  
```

### arc_memory_alignment "n"

Memory alignment to cache lines width of n=32bytes or n=64bytes

```
	arc_memory_alignment 64		; 
```

### arc_flush

```
    arc_flush  0 ; forced flush of data in MProcessing and shared tasks
```

### arc_map_hwblock

```
     arc_map_hwblock   0  map the buffer to a memory offset, default = #0 (VID0)
```

### arc_jitter_ctrl

Command used during the compilation step for the FIFO buffer memory allocation with some margin.

Without this jitter added margin , the buffer size is the largest frame size value between producer and consumer of the arc.

```
    arc_jitter_ctrl  1.5  ; factor to apply to the minimum size between the producer and the consumer, default = 1.0 (no jitter) 
```

### arc_parameters

Arcs data structures are used to allocate large memory used as node parameters. This is done during the node declaration. The node manifest declares this "arc is used as parameter area" for large parameters (NN model, video file, etc ..). There is no data producers for this type of arc.

```
    arc_parameters  0       ; (parameter arcs) buffer preloading, or arc descriptor set with script 
       7  i8; 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 ; parameters                                                            
    include 1 filter_parameters.txt ; path + text file-name using parameter syntax                    
    end

## arm_stream_script (tbd)

Scripts are nodes interpreted from byte codes declared in the indexed SCRIPTS section of the graph, or inlined in the parameter section of the node "arm_stream_script". The first one are simple code sequences used as subroutines or called in the "node_script "index".

The nodes can manage the data RAM location in a shared arc for all script (instance registers+stack parameters) constants are placed after the byte-codes.

The default memory configuration is "shared" meaning the buffers associated with the script are sharing the same memory buffer. 

To have individual static memory associated to a script the "script_mem_shared" must be 0.

Special functions activated with Syscall and conditional instructions:

- if-then: a block of nodes based on script decision (FIFO content/debug registers, ..)
- loop : repeat a list of node several time for cache efficiency and small frame size
- end thread : the script is the last one before a list of low-priority nodes (see "node_map_thread") and we can flush the on going IO (check_graph_boundaries()) and/or return to the application.

## arm_stream_router (tbd)

**Operation** 

This node receives up to 4 streams (arcs) and generate up to 4 stream, each can be multichannel. The Format of the streams is known with the "reset and "set param" commands to the node. 

Input streams are moved, routed and mixed to generate the output streams in a desired stream format. The output stream are isochronous to the other graph streams (they have a known sampling rate), but the input can be asynchronous (each sample have a time-stamp).

The first parameters give the number of arcs, the input arc to use with HQoS (High Quality of Service), or -1. Followed by a list of routing and mixing information. When there is an HQoS arc the amount of data moves is aligned with it, in the time-domain, to all the other arcs (in case of flow issue data is zeroed or interpolated). Otherwise the node checks all the input and output arcs and finds the minimum amount of data, in the time domain, possible for all arcs. 

**Use-cases**

The following use-cases can be combined:

1. Router, deinterleaving, interleaving, channels recombination: the input arc data is processed deinterleaved, and the output arc is the result of recombination of any input arc. Audio example with two stereo input arcs using 5ms and 12ms frame lengths, recombined to create a stereo stream interleaved output using 20ms frame length, the left channel from the first arc and the left channel of the second arc.

2. Router and mixer with smoothed gain control: the output arc data can result from the weighted mix of input arcs. The applied gain can be changed on the fly. The slope of the time taken to the desired gain is controlled. Audio example: a mono output arc is computed from the combination of two stereo input arc, by mixing the four input channels with a factor 0.25 applied in the mixer.

3. Router and raw data conversion. The raw formats can be converted to any other format in this list : int16, int32, int64, float16, float32, float64.

4. Router and sampling-rate conversion of isochronous streams (input streams have a determined and independent sampling-rate). Audio example: input streams sampled at 44100Hz is converted to 48000Hz + 0.026Hz for drift compensation (the sampling-rate information, and all the details of the arc's data format, is shared by the graph scheduler during the reset phase of the nodes).

5. Router and conversion of asynchronous streams using time-stamps to an isochronous stream with a determined sampling-rate. Motion sensor example: an accelerometer is sampled at 200Hz (5ms period)  with +/- 1ms jitter sampling time uncertainty. The samples are provided with an accurate time-stamp in float32 format of time differences between samples (or float64 for absolute time reference to Jan 1st 2025). The output samples are delivered resampled at 410Hz with no jitter.

6. Router of data needing a time synchronization at sample or frame level. In this use-case the node waits the input samples are arriving within a time window before delivering an output frame. Example with motor control and the capture of current and voltage on two input arcs: it is important to send time-synchronized pairs of data. The command [node_script “index”](node_script-"index") is used to call a script checking the arrival of current and voltage with their respective time-stamps (logged in the arc descriptors), the scripts check the arrival of data within a time and release execution of the router when conditions are met.

7. Router of streams generated from different threads. The problem is to avoid on multiprocessing devices one channel to be delivered to the final mixer ahead and desynchronized from the others. This problem is solved with an external script controlling the system time like in the use-case 6.

   

**Parameters**

The list of routing and mixing information is :

- index of the input arc (<= 4)
- index of the channels (1 Byte to 31 Bytes)
- index of the output destination arc (<=4)
- index of the channels (1 Byte to 31 Bytes) 
- mixer gain to apply (fp32) and convergence speed (fp32)



Example with the router with two stereo input arcs and two output arcs at 16kHz sampling rate. The first output arc is mono and the sum of the input channels of the first input, upsampled to 48kHz in float32. The second arc is a stereo combination of the two left channels of the input arcs, at the same sampling rate but with 32bits/sample instead of 16bits for the input.

Operations :

- when receiving the reset command: compute the time granularity for the processing, check if bypass are possible (identical sampling rate on input and output arcs).
- check all input and output arcs to know which is the amount of data (in the time domain) which can me routed and split in "time granularity" chunks. Clear the mixer buffers.

Loop with "time granularity" increments :

- copy the input arcs data in internal FIFO in fp32 format, deinterleaved, with time-stamps attached to each samples.
- use Lagrange polynomial interpolation to resample the FIFO to the output rate. The interpolator is preceded by a an adaptive low-pass filter removing high-frequency content when the estimated input sampling rate higher than the output rate.
- recombination and mixing of resampled data using a programmable gain and smoothed ramp-up to the target value.
- raw data format conversion to the output arc
