# Platform Manifest

The “Top” platform manifest has four sections.

1. The first section lists file paths to improve readability.

2. The second section specifies the name of the manifest file describing the processing architecture (see the next paragraph).

3. The third section lists the available data streams that can be connected to a graph.  
   This list corresponds to manifest files describing data format options and provides an index (IO_AL_idx) for the function used to read or write data and update the stream configuration.

The following fields are associated with each data stream entry.

- path: path identifier.  

- Manifest: manifest file name.  
- IO_AL_idx: index used in the graph.  
- ProcCtrl: processor ID affinity bit field.  
- ClockDomain: provision for ASRC (clock domain).  

Some I/Os can alternatively be clocked from the system clock (0) or from other clocks.  
The system integrator uses this field to decide whether flow errors are handled with buffer interpolation (0) or ASRC (other clock domain index).  
The clock domain index is used only to group and synchronize data flows by domain.

1. The fourth section lists the nodes already installed in the device.  This is also a list of manifest files that formally describe how nodes can be connected to each other.

# IO Manifest 

The graph interface manifests (“IO manifests”) are text files composed of commands used by the graph compiler to understand the type of data flowing through the I/Os of the graph.  
A manifest provides a precise list of information about the data format, such as frame length, data type, and sampling rate.

An IO manifest starts with a header containing general information, followed by a list of commands used to describe the stream.  
The IO manifest reader assumes default values, and associated commands may be omitted or included by the programmer for information and readability purposes.

Because of the variety of stream data types and configuration options, the graph interpreter introduces the concept of physical domains (audio, motion, 2D, and others).  
The document starts with general information describing the digital format of the stream, followed by specifications of domain-related information.

## IO manifest header 

The "IO manifest" starts with the name which will be used in a GUI design tool, followed by the "domain" (list below). 

Example of a simple IO manifest :

```
    io_name     io_platform_sensor_in_0  ; the IO name
    io_domain   analog_in				 ; the domain of operation
```

### List of IO Domains

See [Stream format "domains"](#Stream-format-"domains")

## Declaration of options

The manifest provides a list of possible options, described either as a list or as a range of values.  
The syntax consists of an index followed by a list of numbers enclosed in braces “{” and “}”.  
The index specifies the default value to select from the list.  
An index value of “1” corresponds to the first element of the list.  
An index value of “0” means “any value”.  
In this case, the list may be empty.

Example of a list of options between five values, the index is 2 meaning the default value is the second in the list (value = 6).

```
{ 2   5 6 7 8 9 }
```

When the index is negative the list is decoded as a "range". A Range is a set of three fields : 

- the first option
- the step to the next possible option
- the last (included) option

The absolute index value selects the default value in this range.

Example of an option list of values (1, 1.2, 1.4, 1.6, 1.8, .. , 4.2), the index is -3 meaning the default value is the third in the list (value = 1.4).

```
 { -3    1 0.2 4.2 } 
```

## Default values of an IO manifest

When not mentioned in the manifest the following assumptions are :

| io manifest command    | default value | comments                                  |
| ---------------------- | ------------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| io_commander0_servant1 | 1             | servant                                   |
| io_set0copy1           | 0             | buffer address is set by the scheduler    |
| io_direction_rx0tx1    | 0             | input stream to the graph                 |
| io_raw_format          | int16         | integer 16bits is the default data format |
| io_interleaving        | 0             | raw data interleaving                     |
| io_nb_channels         | 1             | mono                                      |
| io_frame_length        | 1             | in byte (mono or multichannel)            |

## Common information of all digital stream

IO manifests describe the stream data format and how data is copied or used.  
This information applies to digital streams of any IO.  
The next section, “IO Controls Bit-fields per domain (IO-Controls-Bit-fields-per-domain)”, is specific to each domain of operation.

### io_commander0_servant1 "0/1"

An IO is a “commander” when it initiates data exchanges with the graph without control from the scheduler, for example an audio codec.  
An IO is a “servant” when the scheduler must asynchronously pull or push data by calling abstraction-layer IO functions, for example an interface to the main application.

IO streams are managed by the graph scheduler using one subroutine per IO, referenced by the IO_AL_idx function of the abstraction layer, using the following template:

```
typedef void (*p_io_function_ctrl)(uint32_t command, void *data, uint32_t length);
```

The command parameter can take the following values:  
STREAM_SET_PARAMETER, STREAM_DATA_START, STREAM_STOP, or STREAM_SET_BUFFER.

Once a data transfer is complete, the external IO driver calls arm_graph_interpreter_io_ack() to notify the scheduler so it can update the corresponding arc.

```
void arm_graph_interpreter_io_ack(uint8_t graph_io_idx, void *data, uint32_t size);
```

Example:

```
io_commander0_servant1  1  ; default is servant (1)
```

**Graph interpreter implementation details**

IO streams are managed by the graph scheduler using one subroutine per IO, with the following template:

typedef void (*p_io_function_ctrl)(uint32_t command, uint8_t *data, uint32_t length);

The command parameter can take the following values:  
STREAM_SET_PARAMETER, STREAM_DATA_START, STREAM_STOP, or STREAM_SET_BUFFER.

When the IO is a commander, it calls arm_graph_interpreter_io_ack() when data is read.  
When the IO is a servant, the scheduler calls p_io_function_ctrl(STREAM_RUN, …) to request a data transfer.  
Once the transfer is complete, the IO driver calls arm_graph_interpreter_io_ack().

### io_buffer_alloc_in_graph "0/1"

This command declares whether the IO stream uses a memory area provided by the scheduler.  
The default value is 0.

```
io_buffer_alloc_in_graph  1  ; data buffer is allocated in the graph
```

### io_set0copy1 "0/1"

This command tells with "0" the programs outside of the graph are providing the address of the data being exchanged. In this case the IO arc descriptor's base address is patched with the address provided during the call of arm_stream_io_ack(ioidx, *, n).

With "1" the command tell the data will be exchanged with a memory allocation of the FIFO in the graph. The data is exchanged outside of the graph with a memory copy.

```
io_set0copy1 0 ; default configuration, memory allocation is made outside of the graph
```

### io_direction_rx0tx1 "0/1"

This command declares the direction of the stream from the graph scheduler’s point of view.

```
io_direction_rx0tx1   1  ; direction of the stream  0:input 1:output 
```

### io_raw_format "option"

Declaration of the size and type of the raw [Data Types](#Data-Types) using the [Declaration of options](#Declaration-of-options) format.

```
io_raw_format {1 3}  ; raw arithmetic's computation format is STREAM_S16 
```

### io_interleaving "0/1"

```
io_interleaving    1  ; multichannel interleaved (0), deinterleaved by frame-size (1) 
```

### io_nb_channels "option"

Declaration of the possible number of channels using the [Declaration of options](#Declaration-of-options) format.

```
io_nb_channels {2  1 2 3 4}  ; options for the number of channels, stereo default
```

### io_frame_length "option"

Declaration of the possible frame length using the [Declaration of options](#Declaration-of-options) format, in bytes. A sample can be multichannel but is still counted as one sample.

```
io_frame_length  {1 1 2 16 }   ; options of possible frame_length in bytes
```

### io_frame_duration "U option"

Declaration of the possible frame duration using the [Declaration of options](#Declaration-of-options) format, in a time unit given in the first parameter. See [Standard units](#Standard-units).

```
io_frame_duration minutes {1 1 2 16 }   ; options of possible frame_length in minutes
```

### io_setup_time  "x"

This command provides information about the time required before valid or calibrated samples are ready for processing after reset.  
This information is provided for documentation purposes only.

```
io_setup_time  12.5 ; wait 12.5ms before receiving valid data
```

### io_units_rescale "u a b max"

The syntax is: physical unit name, coefficient a, coefficient b, and maximum value.  
This command provides rescaling information between normalized digital units (1.0 or 0x7FFF) and physical units, using the formula P = a × (D − b).

See file [Units](#Units) for the list of available Units from RFC8798 and RFC8428.  

```
io_units_rescale  vrms  0.0135  -10.1  0.15

; V_physical = a x (X_sample - b) with the default hardware settings
; V [VRMS] <=> 0.0135 x ( X - (-10.1)) 
; 0.15 VRMS <=> 0.0135 x (1.0 - (-10.1))  0.15 Vrms corresponds to digital full-scale 
```

### io_subtype_multiple "..."

This command declares multiple interleaved units with individual rescaling factors defined by io_units_rescale.  
It is used, for example, with motion sensors delivering acceleration, speed, magnetic field, temperature, and similar data.

```
io_subtype_multiple DPS a b max GAUSS a b max
```

### io_position "U 3D"

This command declares the position of the IO in a three-dimensional space using the unit specified by the first parameter. See [Standard units](#Standard-units).

```
io_position centimeter  1.1 -2.2 0.01 ; relative XYZ position from the platform reference point
```

### io_euler_angles "U 3A"

This specifies the relative XYZ position with respect to the platform reference point. See [Standard units](#Standard-units).

```
io_euler_angles degree 10 20 88.5  ; Euler angles with respect to the platform reference orientation, in degrees
```

### io_sampling_rate "U option"

This command declares the IO stream sampling rate using the frequency unit specified by the first parameter. See [Standard units](#Standard-units).

```
io_sampling_rate hertz {2 16e3 44.1e3 48000} ; sampling rate options in Hz=9
```

### io_sampling_period "U option"

Declaration of the sampling period using the [Declaration of options](#Declaration-of-options) format, in a time unit given in the first parameter. See [Standard units](#Standard-units).

```
io_sampling_period  second {1 1 60 120 }  ; sampling period, enumeration in seconds (4)   
```

### io_sampling_rate_accuracy "p"

Percentage of random inaccuracy of the given sampling rate. 

```
io_sampling_rate_accuracy  0.01   ; in percentage, or 100ppm
```

### io_time_stamp_format "option"

See file [Units](#Units) for the definition of time-stamp format inserted before each frame :

- 0: no time stamp
- 1: simple counter
- 2: time difference in float32 [seconds] 
- 3: time distance from Unix epoch in float64 [seconds]

```
io_time_stamp_format {1 2} ; time-stamp differences
```


--------------------------

## IO Controls Bit-fields per domain

The graph starts with a table of four words per IO.  
The first word is used to connect the IO with the graph, including the arc index, direction, and the index of the associated abstraction-layer function.  
Three 32-bit words are reserved for domain-specific tuning items, referred to below as W1 and W2.

### Domain audio_in and audio_out

#### Domain audio_in setting W1
