## No-Code

Nano-Graph is an interpreter of a representation of a "graph file" which is a compact representation of memory allocation, the connection of streams to a graph of computing nodes.

no recompilation with manifests : 1) binary installed, graph in flash, partly copied in RAM and interpreted  2) other options : recompilation, all in RAM, ..

layers : node are called by the scheduler of Nano-Graph. A list of computing services are proposed to the nodes to create an abstraction to optimized compute libraries and hardware coprocessors.

The "graph file" scripts, callbacks 

entry-points of the scheduler



platform, HW, RAM, copro, flash_graph, TCM, map,  mmu , CPU/ARCH/Thread

Manifest : domain, format, memory reserved, type (backup, static)

Node manifest : memory allocation, swap, copro/compute lib

scheduling cache and arcs

reset sequence

IO format
